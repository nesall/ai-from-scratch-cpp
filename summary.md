# AI From Scratch in C++

## Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression (MSE Loss, Gradient Descent)
- Logistic Regression (Sigmoid, Cross-Entropy)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (Euclidean distance, voting)
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian model, priors)
- Decision Trees (Entropy, Information Gain)
- Random Forest (Bootstrap, ensemble voting)
- Support Vector Machines (margin maximization, kernel trick)
- Perceptron (basic neural model, activation functions)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP, Backpropagation, ReLU/Sigmoid)
- CNN (Convolutions, Pooling, MNIST classification)
- RNN (Sequential inputs, Backpropagation Through Time)

## Optimizers
- SGD (baseline optimizer)
- Momentum (accelerated SGD)
- AdaGrad (per-parameter learning rates)
- RMSProp (adaptive learning with decay)
- Adam (adaptive + momentum, most popular)

## Regularization
- L1/L2 Penalties (weight shrinkage)
- Dropout (preventing co-adaptation)
- Early stopping (prevent overfitting)

## Unsupervised Learning
- k-Means (clustering via distance to centers)
- PCA (dimensionality reduction via eigen decomposition)

## Reinforcement Learning
- Q-Learning (value iteration, exploration vs exploitation)
- Gridworld demonstration

## Evolutionary Algorithms
- Genetic Algorithm (selection, crossover, mutation)
- Fitness-based optimization

## Capstone: AI Playground
Interactive SFML app with tabs/scenes:
- Linear Regression
- Optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp, Momentum)
- Regularization (noisy LR vs others)
- Convolutions (blurring demo)
- Genetic Algorithm visualization
- k-Means clustering (emergent clusters)
- Q-Learning agent (gridworld)

Playground demonstrates supervised, unsupervised, RL, and evolutionary paradigms in one interface.
